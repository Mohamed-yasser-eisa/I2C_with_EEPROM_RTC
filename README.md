# I2C_with_EEPROM_RTC
 
Build date: (15 April, 2022)

This is an individual project.

1- Project description:

    This project is based on I2C serial communication protocol, with single master 
    and multi-slaves. The user can press any key from 1 to 16 through the 4x4 
    keypad, when any key from 1 to 14 is pressed a message is printed on the LCD 
    "Key number = X", where 'X' is the key number. Then the pressed key is saved 
    automatically on the external EEPROM with its date and time. Key 15 prints the 
    last pressed key, and when key 15 is pressed twice it prints the key before 
    the last and so on... Key 16 erases the external EEPROM with a message on LCD 
    "Clearing Memâ€¦".

2- Tools:

    (ATmega32, RTC module, External EEPROM, LCD, 4x4 Keypad, I2C debugger, Atmel 
    studio IDE).
